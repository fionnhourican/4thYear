A Data Warehouse is the model or structure that supports data mining and decision support. This module teaches students how to build Data Warehouses by understanding their structures and the concept of multi-dimensional modelling. It also covers Data Mining to teach students how to extract knowledge from data warehouses using three different approaches: clustering, association rule mining and classification.

Learning Outcomes

1. Be able to build Data Warehouses for different application types
2. Be able to deploy the Data Warehouse Bus Matrix to create individual data marts.
3. Be able to design a multi-dimensional schema model.
4. Analyse the different strategies and techniques involved in Data Mining, and choose the correct approach for each dataset.
5. Be able to construct and deploy data mining algorithms.
6. Be able to determine the predictive accuracy of data mining algorithms
